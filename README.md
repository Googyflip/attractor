Strange Attractor
=================

Strange Attractor plugin for Blender. This is a fork from https://github.com/mtyka/attractor from original excellent work. This has been maintained by @7bitretro with some corrections from Spirou4D@laposte.net, to update the code for compatibility for more recent versions of Blender.

A Strange Attractor is a concept in chaos theory that describes the behavior of chaotic systems. Unlike a regular attractor, which predicts stable patterns with fixed positions, a strange attractor leads to semi-stable patterns that lack a specific spatial location. One famous example is the Lorenz attractor, which emerged from a mathematical experiment in weather prediction and revealed an unexpected link between weather, chaos, and fractals. These attractors exhibit fascinating properties, such as points on the attractor being arbitrarily far apart at different times, making their behavior quite unpredictable.

Installation instructions: Go to Edit->Preferences

Select Add-ons from the tabs on the left of the Window. 

At the top of the window click "Install..."

Find and select the file ```attractor_blender_3_3.py``` and click the ```Install Add-on...``` button.

To create an attractor curve, press Shift-A to add an object and select Curve menu. 

At the bottom there should now be an entry "Attractors...".

Select that and an attractor of your choice (Lorenz is a good place to start).
